Fix cog stop/restart bug in servo library and add feature for disabling individual
servos.
</li>
<li> 
Add example named SD for Text Files and Back to Variables to ...Documents\SimpleIDE\Learn\Examples\Devices\Memory.

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li> 
Updated delay built into simpletools library that ensures Windows machines cannot mistake the Propeller for a plug and play serial device.  This can happen if the Windows machine receives serial bytes within 0.7 seconds after the device is connected.  This delay now only occurs at application start-up, not every time the terminal process is restarted.
</li>
<li> 
Fixed bug in square_wave function.
</li>
<li> 
Fixed shift_in MSBPRE bug that added an n+1 bit to the result.

persist in EEPROM and be used by the abdrive library.
</li>
</ul>
</p>  

<p>
Updates 5/1/2014  
<br>
<ul>
<li> 
The simpletools library no longer starts a floating point coprocessor at the start of the application.  All floating point functionality is still supported, processing just happens in the same cog.
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
</p>  

<p>

<br>
<ul>
<li> 
abvolts library added.  This library is for introductory tutorials and has been added to the Learn folder for community testing and feedback.
</li>
</ul>
</p>  

<p>

</ul>
</p>  

<p>
Updates 9/4/2013  
<br>
<ul>
<li> 
ee_put* Fixed bug that prevented contiguous data crossing address/128 boundary.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
Updated stack array to static in mstimer.c.
</li>
</ul>
</p>  

<p>
Updates 7/9/2013  
<br>
<ul>
<li> 
i2c_in and i2c_out functions added to simpletools library.
</li>
<br>
<li> 
simplei2c library added with basic i2c building blocks that were used to create the simpletools library's i2c_in and i2c_out functions.
</li>
<br>
<li> 
EEPROM and compass libraries now use i2c_in and i2c_out instead of two different Propeller GCC I2C variants, which reduces program memory requirements.  
</li>
</ul>
</p>  
</ul>

<p>
Updates 6/15/2013  
<br>
<ul>
<li> 
Folder added.../SimpleIDE/Learn/Simple Libraries/Text Devices.  In addition to libraries that support communication with text based hardware devices, this folder has libsimpletext, which has compact functions for sending and receiving text to/from Simple Terminal and other devices.
</li>
<br>
<li> 
All sser_ and fdser_ functions removed from libsimpletools.
</li>
<br>
<li> 
libsimpletools now includes simpletext from Text Devices.  In addition to replacing sser_ functions, it has a variety of print/scan put/get and read/write functions for communicating with Simple Terminal and other serial devices.  fdser_ functions are replaced by using the Add Simple Library button to add libfdserial from the Text Devices folder.  
</li>
<br>
<li> 
7-segment LED examples added to ...SimpleIDE/Learn/Examples/Circuits.  
</li>
<br>
<li> 
A 0.8 second delay was added to the first serial message sent to Simple Terminal by functions in the simpletext library.  This prevents Windows machines from potentially mistaking the serial message as legacy serial peripheral identifying strings.  Since the delay is now automatic, all pause(1000) calls were removed from the start of example programs.
</li>
<br>
<li> 
All example programs updated to use print from simpletext in place of printf from stdio.  This significantly reduces the program size penalty for displaying floating point types.  
</li>
</ul>
</p>  
</ul>
