  I/O Pins connections: 
  
  P8  -> CLK      (SCK)
  P7 <-> DATA     (SDI)
  P6  -> /ENABLE  (CS)  
  
  Instructions:
  
  Connect LIS3DH module to Propeller using the pins shown above
  Also connect 3.3V and GND to the LIS3DH module
  Upload this code to the Propeller
  Open SimpleIDE Terminal or Parallax Serial Terminal at 115200 baud to view the output
