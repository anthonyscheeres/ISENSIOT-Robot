/*
  Keypad 4x4 Read Simultaneous Keys.c
  Demonstrates how to read keys when more than one might be
  pressed.  
  
  Caution, 2 keys is always correct, but 3 keys is not 
  always dependable.  Many combinations of up to 4 keys work
  fine, but certain combinations can result in ghosting on 
  keypads that do not have built-in diodes to prevent that.  
  
  Ghosting happens when two keys on the same row are pressed 
  and a third key on the same column with one the first two is
  pressed.  For example, pressing 1, 2, and 7 will result in
  1, 2, 7, and 8 being returned
